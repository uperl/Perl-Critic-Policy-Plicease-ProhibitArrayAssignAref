# When some of META.yml is generated by explicit text in Makefile.PL it can
# be easy to make a mistake in the syntax, or indentation, etc, so the idea
# here is to check it's readable from some of the YAML readers.
#
# The various readers differ in how strictly they look at the syntax.
# There's no attempt here to say one of them is best or tightest or
# whatever, just see that they all work.
#
# See 0-test-yaml-meta.t for Test::YAML::Meta which looks into field
# contents, as well as maybe the YAML formatting.
