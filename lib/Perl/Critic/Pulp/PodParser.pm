=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Pulp::PodParser - shared POD parsing code for the Pulp perlcritic add-on

 use base 'Perl::Critic::Pulp::PodParser';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is only meant for internal use yet.

It's some shared parse-from-element, error suppression, no output, violation
accumulation and violation line number things for POD parsing in policies.
