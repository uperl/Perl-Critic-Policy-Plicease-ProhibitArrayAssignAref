=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Pulp - some add-on perlcritic policies

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of add-on policies for C<Perl::Critic>, summarized
below.  They're under a "pulp" theme plus other themes according to their
purpose (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

Roughly half are code related and half cosmetic.  You can always enable or
disable the ones you do or don't want.  It's normal to pick and choose
things reported.  There's a lot of perlcritic policies both built-in and
add-on and they range from helpful things catching problems through to the
bizarre or restrictive, and in some cases mutually contradictory!  Many are
only intended as building blocks for enforcing a house style.  If you try to
pass everything then you'll give away big parts of the language, so if
you're not turning off or customizing about half then you're either not
trying or you're much too easily lead!

=head1 OTHER NOTES

In most of the perlcritic documentation, including the Pulp stuff here,
policy names appear without the full C<Perl::Critic::Policy::...> class
part.  In Emacs try C<man-completion.el> to have C<M-x man> automatically
expand a suffix part at point, or C<ffap-perl-module.el> to go to the source
similarly.

    http://user42.tuxfamily.org/man-completion/index.html

    http://user42.tuxfamily.org/ffap-perl-module/index.html

In perlcritic's output you can ask for %P for the full policy name to copy
or follow.  Here's a good format you can put in your F<.perlcriticrc>,
including file:line:column: style Emacs will recognise.

    verbose=%f:%l:%c:\n %P\n %m\n

See L<Perl::Critic::Violation> for all the C<%> escapes.  F<perlcritic.el>
has patterns for Emacs to match the builtin perlcritic formats, but it's
easier to print file:line:column:.
