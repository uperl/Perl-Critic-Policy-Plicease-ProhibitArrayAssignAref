=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Pulp - some add-on perlcritic policies

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of the following add-on policies for C<Perl::Critic>.
They're under a new "pulp" theme, plus other themes according to their
function (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

=over 4

=item ConstantBeforeLt -- avoiding problems with C<< FOO < 123 >>

See L<Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::ConstantBeforeLt>.

=item ConstantPragmaHash -- version declaration for hash style multi-constants

See L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Compatibility::ConstantPragmaHash>.

=item NotWithCompare -- avoiding problems with C<! $x == $y>

See L<Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::NotWithCompare>.

=item ProhibitEmptyCommas -- stray consecutive commas

See L<Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyCommas>.

=item ProhibitNullStatements -- stray semicolons

See L<Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitNullStatements>.

=item RequireEndBeforeLastPod -- __END__ before POD at end of file

See L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::RequireEndBeforeLastPod>.

=item TextDomainPlaceholders -- check args to C<__x> and C<__nx>

See L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Miscellanea::TextDomainPlaceholders>.

=item UnexpandedSpecialLiteral -- literal use of __PACKAGE__ etc

See L<Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::UnexpandedSpecialLiteral>.

Roughly half are bugs and half cosmetic.  You can always enable or disable
the ones you do or don't want.  You'll have realized there's a lot of
perlcritic builtin and add-on policies and they range from very helpful to
very bizarre, and in some cases mutually contradictory.  So it's quite
normal to pick and choose what you want reported.  If you're not turning off
about 1 in 4 and customizing others then either you're not trying or you're
much too easily lead!

=head1 OTHER NOTES

In a lot of the perlcritic docs, including the Pulp ones here, policy names
appear without the full C<Perl::Critic::Policy::...> class name.  In Emacs
have a look at C<man-completion.el> to automatically get the man page from a
suffix part (at point), or C<ffap-perl-module.el> to go to the source.

=back

In perlcritic's output you can ask for %P for the full name.  Here's a good
format for your F<.perlcriticrc>, including file:line:column: which Emacs
recognises (see L<Perl::Critic::Violation> on the C<%> escapes).

    verbose=%f:%l:%c:\n %P\n %m\n

F<perlcritic.el> has patterns to match the builtin formats, but it's a lot
easier to make perlcritic print file:line:column: in the first place.
