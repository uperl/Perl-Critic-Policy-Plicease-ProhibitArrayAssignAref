=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Pulp - some add-on perlcritic policies

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of add-on policies for C<Perl::Critic>, summarized
below.  They're under a new "pulp" theme plus other themes according to
their purpose (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

Roughly half are code related and half cosmetic.  You can always enable or
disable the ones you do or don't want.  It's normal to pick and choose what
you want reported.  There's a lot of perlcritic builtin and add-on policies
and they range from helpful things catching problems, to the bizarre or
restrictive, and in some cases are mutually contradictory!  Many are
intended as building blocks for enforcing a house style.  If you try to pass
everything then you'll give away big parts of the language, so if not
turning off or customizing about half then either you're not trying or
you're much too easily lead!

=head1 OTHER NOTES

In most of the perlcritic documentation, including the Pulp here, policy
names appear without the full C<Perl::Critic::Policy::...> class name.  In
Emacs have a look at C<man-completion.el> for C<M-x man> to automatically
expand a suffix part at point, or C<ffap-perl-module.el> to go to the source
similarly.

    http://user42.tuxfamily.org/man-completion/index.html

    http://user42.tuxfamily.org/ffap-perl-module/index.html

In perlcritic's output you can ask for %P for the full policy name to copy
or follow.  Here's a good format you can put in your F<.perlcriticrc>, with
a file:line:column: Emacs will recognise too.  See
L<Perl::Critic::Violation> for all the C<%> escapes.

    verbose=%f:%l:%c:\n %P\n %m\n

F<perlcritic.el> has patterns to match the builtin formats, but it's easier
to print file:line:column: in the first place.
