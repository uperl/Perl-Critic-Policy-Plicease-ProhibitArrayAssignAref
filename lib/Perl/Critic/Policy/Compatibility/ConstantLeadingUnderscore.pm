=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Compatibility::ConstantLeadingUnderscore - new enough "constant" module for leading underscores

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
add-on.  It asks that if you have a constant with a leading underscore,

    use constant _FOO ...  # leading underscore on name

then you explicitly declare C<use 5.6> or C<use constant 1.02>, or higher,
since C<constant.pm> before that did not allow leading underscores.

    use constant _FOO => 123;        # bad

    use 5.006;
    use constant _FOO => 123;        # ok

    use constant 1.02;
    use constant _FOO => 123;        # ok

    use constant 1.02 _FOO => 123;   # ok

The idea is to avoid trouble in code which might run on Perl 5.005, or might
in principle still run there.  On that basis this policy is under the
"compatibility" theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

Asking for the new enough module C<use constant 1.02> is suggested, since
it's the module feature which is required and the code might then still run
on Perl 5.005 or earlier if the user has a suitable C<constant.pm> from
CPAN.

=head2 Details

A version declaration must be before the first leading underscore, so it's
checked before the underscore is attempted (and gives an error).

    use constant _FOO => 123;        # bad
    use 5.006;

A C<require> for the Perl version is not enough since the C<use constant> is
at C<BEGIN> time, before plain code.

    require 5.006;                   # doesn't run early enough
    use constant _FOO => 123;        # bad

But a C<require> within a C<BEGIN> block is ok (an older style, still found
occasionally).

    BEGIN { require 5.006 }
    use constant _FOO => 123;        # ok

    BEGIN {
      require 5.006;
      and_other_setups ...;
    }
    use constant _FOO => 123;        # ok

Currently ConstantLeadingUnderscore pays no attention to any conditionals
within the C<BEGIN>, it assumes any C<require> there always runs.  It might
be tricked by obscure tests but hopefully anything like that is rare.

A quoted version number like

    use constant '1.02';    # no good

is no good, only a bare number is recognised by the C<use> statement.
A string like that in fact goes through to C<constant> as a name to define
(which it will reject).

Leading underscores in the multi-constant hash are not flagged, since if
you've got multi-constants then you've got underscores.  See
L<Compatibility::ConstantPragmaHash|Perl::Critic::Policy::Compatibility::ConstantPragmaHash>
for checking multi-constants.

    use constant { _FOO => 1 };      # not checked

Leading double-underscore is disallowed by all versions of C<constant.pm>.
That's not reported by this policy since the code won't run at all.

    use constant __FOO = 123;  # not allowed by any constant.pm

=head2 Drawbacks

Explicitly adding required version numbers in the code can be irritating,
especially if other things you're using only run on 5.6 up anyway.  But
declaring what code needs is accurate, it allows maybe for backports of
modules, and explicit versions can be grepped out to create or check
F<Makefile.PL> or F<Build.PL> prereqs.

As always if you don't care about this and in particular if you only ever
use Perl 5.6 anyway then you can disable C<ConstantLeadingUnderscore> from
your F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way (see
L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),

    [-Compatibility::ConstantLeadingUnderscore]

=head1 OTHER WAYS TO DO IT

It's easy to write your own constant subr and it can have any name at all
(anything acceptable to Perl), bypassing the sanity checks or restrictions
in C<constant.pm>.  Only the C<()> prototype is a bit obscure.

    sub _FOO () { return 123 }

The key benefit of subs like this, whether from C<constant.pm> or
explicitly, is that the value is inlined and can be constant-folded in an
arithmetic expression etc (see L<perlsub/Constant Functions>).

    print 2*_FOO;   # folded to 246 at compile-time

The purpose of a leading underscore is normally a hint that the sub is meant
to be private to the module and/or its friends.  If you don't need the
constant folding then a C<my> scalar is even more private, being invisible
to anything outside the relevant scope,

    my $FOO = 123;         # more private
    # ...
    do_something ($FOO);   # nothing to constant-fold anyway

The scalar from a constant sub is flagged read-only, which might prevent
accidental when passed around.  The C<Readonly> module can have a similar
effect on scalars.  If you've got C<Readonly::XS> then it's just a flag too
(no performance penalty on using the value).

    use Readonly;
    Readonly::Scalar my $FOO => 123;
