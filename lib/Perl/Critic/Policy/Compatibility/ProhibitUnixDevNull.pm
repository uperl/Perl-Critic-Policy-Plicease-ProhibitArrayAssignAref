=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Compatibility::ProhibitUnixDevNull - don't use explicit /dev/null

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
add-on.  It ask you to not to use filename F</dev/null> explicitly, but
instead C<File::Spec-E<gt>devnull()> for maximum portability across
operating systems.

This policy is under the C<maintenance> theme (see
L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>) on the basis that even if you're on a Unix
system now you never know where your code might travel in the future.

C<devnull()> is new in C<File::Spec> version 0.8, so you should require that
version (it's included in Perl 5.6.0 and up).

The checks for F</dev/null> are unsophisticated.  A violation is reported
for any string C</dev/null>, possibly with an C<open> style mode part, or
any C<qw> containing C</dev/null>.

    open my $fh, '< /dev/null';                    # bad
    do_something ("/dev/null");                    # bad
    foreach my $file (qw(/dev/null /etc/passwd))   # bad

String comparisons are allowed because they're not uses of F</dev/null> as
such but likely some sort of cross-platform check.

    if ($f eq '/dev/null') { ... }                 # ok
    return ($f ne '>/dev/null');                   # ok

"/dev/null" as just part of a string is allowed, including things like
backticks and C<system>.

    print "Flames to /dev/null please\n"           # ok
    system ('rmdir /foo/bar >/dev/null 2>&1');     # ok
    $hi = `echo hi </dev/null`;                    # ok

Whether F</dev/null> is a good idea in such command strings depends what
sort of shell you reach and how much of Unix it might emulate on a non-Unix
system.

=head2 Disabling

If you only ever use a system with F</dev/null>, or if everything else you
write is hopelessly wedded to Unix anyway, then you can disable
C<ProhibitUnixDevNull> from your F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way (see
L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),
