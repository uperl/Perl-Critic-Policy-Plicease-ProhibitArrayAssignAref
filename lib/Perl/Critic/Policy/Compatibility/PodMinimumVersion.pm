=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Compatibility::PodMinimumVersion - check Perl version declared against POD features used

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
addon.  It checks that the POD features you use don't exceed your target
Perl version as indicated by C<use 5.008> etc.

=for ProhibitVerbatimMarkup allow next

    use 5.005;

    =pod

    C<< something >>    # bad, double angles needs 5.006

POD doesn't affect how the code runs, so this policy is low priority, and
under the "compatibility" theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

See L<C<Pod::MinimumVersion>|Pod::MinimumVersion> for the POD version checks
applied.  The key idea is for example when targeting Perl 5.005 you avoid
things like double-angles S<C<CE<lt>E<lt> E<gt>E<gt>>>, since C<pod2man> in
5.005 didn't support them.  It may be possible to get newer versions of the
POD translators from CPAN, but whether they run on an older Perl and whether
you want to require that of users is another matter.

Adding the sort of C<use 5.006> etc to declare a target Perl can be a bit
tedious.  The config option below lets you set a base version you use.  As
always if you don't care at all about this sort of thing you can disable the
policy from your F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way (see
L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),

    [-Compatibility::PodMinimumVersion]

=head2 C<RequirePodLinksIncludeText> Policy

The C<Documentation::RequirePodLinksIncludeText> policy asks you to use the
C<LE<lt>target|displayE<gt>> style always.  That feature is new in Perl
5.005 and will be reported by C<PodMinimumVersion> unless you've got C<use
5.005> or higher or set C<above_version> below.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=item C<above_version> (version string, default none)

Report only things about Perl versions above this.  The string is anything
the L<C<version.pm>|version> module understands.  For example if you always
use Perl 5.6 or higher then set

    [Compatibility::PodMinimumVersion]
    above_version = 5.006

The effect is that all POD features up to and including Perl 5.6 are
allowed, only things above that will be reported (and still only those
exceeding any C<use 5.xxx> in the file).
