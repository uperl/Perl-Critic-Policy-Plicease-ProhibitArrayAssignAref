=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::ProhibitAdjacentLinks - consecutive LE<lt>E<gt> links

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
addon.  It asks you not to have two adjacent LE<lt>E<gt> sequences in a
paragraph.  For example,

=for ProhibitVerbatimMarkup allow next 2

    =head1 SEE ALSO

    L<Foo>               # bad
    L<Bar>

The idea is adjacent LE<lt>E<gt> like this is probably a missing comma or
missing text.  It's easy to do in a "SEE ALSO" list.

Of course this is only a very minor typo or readability and on that basis
this policy is under the "cosmetic" theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY
THEMES>) and lowest severity.

=head2 Exceptions

An exception is made for two links to the same page where one (or both) have
display text,

=for ProhibitVerbatimMarkup allow next

    See L<My::Package> L<new()|My::Package/Contructors> for more.

This hyperlinks both the package name and a function etc within it.
Precisely when to allow or disallow this sort of thing might want to be
loosened or tightened in the future.  Adjacent linking is fairly unusual
though, and too much linking is often not a good thing if the meaning is to
be clear in plain text too.

=head2 Disabling

If you don't care about this sort of thing at all you can disable
C<ProhibitAdjacentLinks> from your F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way
(see L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),

    [-Documentation::ProhibitAdjacentLinks]

=head1 BUGS

The column position of the offending adjacency is not worked into the
violation report yet.  It may need a careful look at the line to see the
problem, and at the following line when to adjacent links are across a
newline.
