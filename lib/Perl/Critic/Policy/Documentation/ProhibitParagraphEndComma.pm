=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::ProhibitParagraphEndComma - avoid comma at end of section

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
add-on.  It asks you not to end a POD paragraph with a comma.

    Some text,       # bad, meant to be a full-stop?

    Some more text.

Usually such a comma is meant to be a full-stop, or perhaps omitted at the
end of a "SEE ALSO" list

=for ProhibitVerbatimMarkup allow next 2

    =head1 SEE ALSO

    L<Foo>,
    L<Bar>,          # bad, meant to be omitted?

A paragraph before an C<=over> or a verbatim block can end with a comma,
that being taken as introducing a quotation or example,

    For example,     # ok, introduce an example

        foo(1+2+3)

    Or one of,       # ok, introduce an itemized list

    =over

    =item Foo

=head2 Disabling

If you don't care about this you can disable C<ProhibitParagraphEndComma>
from your F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way (see
L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),
