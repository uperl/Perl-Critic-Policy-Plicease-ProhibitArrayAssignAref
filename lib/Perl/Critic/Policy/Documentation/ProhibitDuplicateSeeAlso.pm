=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::ProhibitDuplicateSeeAlso - don't duplicate LE<lt>E<gt> links in SEE ALSO

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
add-on.  It asks you not to duplicate C<< LE<lt>FooE<gt> >> links in a SEE
ALSO section.

=for ProhibitVerbatimMarkup allow next 3

    =head1 SEE ALSO

    L<Foo::Bar>

    L<Foo::Bar>    # bad

The idea is that for readability a given cross-reference should be linked
just once and a duplicate is likely a leftover from too much cut-and-paste
etc.  This is minor matter so this policy is under the C<cosmetic> theme
(see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>) and low priority.

A module can appear more than once in a SEE ALSO, but only
C<< LE<lt>E<gt> >> linked once and anything else C<< CE<lt>E<gt> >> markup
or plain text.

=for ProhibitVerbatimMarkup allow next

    L<Foo::One>, L<Foo::Two>
    (C<Foo::Two> runs faster)     # ok

Links to different parts of a target POD are allowed,

=for ProhibitVerbatimMarkup allow next

    L<perlfunc/alarm>,
    L<perlfunc/kill>     # ok

=head2 Disabling

If you don't care about this then you can always disable
C<ProhibitDuplicateSeeAlso> from your F<.perlcriticrc> file in the usual way
(see L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),
