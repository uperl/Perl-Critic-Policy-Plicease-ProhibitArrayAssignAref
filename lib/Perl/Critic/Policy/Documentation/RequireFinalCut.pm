=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::RequireFinalCut - end POD with =cut directive

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
add-on.  It asks you to end POD with a C<=cut> directive at the end of a
file.

    =head1 DOCO

    Some text.

    =cut             # ok

The idea is to have a definite end indication for human readers.  Perl and
the POD processors don't require a final C<=cut>.  On that basis this policy
is lowest priority and under the "cosmetic" theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY
THEMES>).

If there's no POD in the file then a C<=cut> is not required.  Or if the POD
is not at the end of file then final C<=cut> at the end is not required.

    =head2 About foo

    =cut

    sub foo {
    }              # ok, file ends with code not POD

If there's POD at end of file but consists only of C<=begin/=end> blocks
then a C<=cut> is not required.  It's reckoned the C<=end> is enough in this
case.

    =begin wikidoc

    Entire document in wiki style.

    =end wikidoc          # ok, =cut not required

If you've got a mixture of POD and C<=begin> blocks then a C<=cut> is still
required.  The special allowance is when the only text an C<=begin> block,
presumably destined for some other markup system.

=head2 Disabling

If you don't care about a final C<=cut> you can disable C<RequireFinalCut>
from your F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way (see
L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),
