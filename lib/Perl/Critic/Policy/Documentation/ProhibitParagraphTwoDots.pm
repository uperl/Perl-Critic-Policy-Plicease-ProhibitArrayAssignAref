=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::ProhibitParagraphTwoDots - don't end a paragraph with two dots

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
add-on.  It asks you not to end a POD paragraph with two dots,

    Some thing..                    # bad

This is a surprisingly easy typo, but of course is entirely cosmetic and on
that basis this policy is lowest priority and under the "cosmetic" theme
(see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

Three or more dots as an ellipsis is fine,

    And some more of this ...       # ok

and anything within a paragraph is fine,

    Numbers 1 .. 10 are handled.    # ok

Only text paragraphs are checked, verbatim paragraphs can end with anything
at all

    This is an example,

        example_code (1 ..          # ok

There might be other dubious paragraph endings this policy could pick up,
but things like ";." or ":." can arise from code or smiley faces, so at the
moment only two dots are bad.

=head2 Disabling

If you don't care about this you can disable C<ProhibitParagraphTwoDots>
from your F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way (see
L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),

    [-Documentation::ProhibitParagraphTwoDots]

A C<## no critic> directive works in new enough C<Perl::Critic>, but if you
have an C<__END__> token then any C<no critic> generally must be before
that.
