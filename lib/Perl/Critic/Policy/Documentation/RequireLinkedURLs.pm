=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::RequireLinkedURLs - use LE<lt>E<gt> markup on URLs in POD

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
addon.  It asks you to put C<LE<lt>E<gt>> markup on URLs in POD text in Perl
5.8 and higher.

    use 5.008;

    =head1 HOME PAGE

    http://foo.org/mystuff/index.html      # bad

=for ProhibitVerbatimMarkup allow next

    L<http://foo.org/mystuff/index.html>   # good

    =cut

C<LE<lt>E<gt>> markup gives clickable links in C<pod2html> and similar
formatters, and even in the plain text formatters it gives
C<E<lt>http://...E<gt>> style angles around the URL which is a
semi-conventional way to delimit from surrounding text and in particular
from an immediately following period or comma.

Of course this is only cosmetic and on that basis this policy is low
priority and under the "cosmetic" theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

Only plain text parts of the POD are considered.  Indented verbatim text
cannot have C<LE<lt>E<gt>> markup (and it's often a mistake to put it, as
per
L<ProhibitVerbatimMarkup|Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::ProhibitVerbatimMarkup>).

    This is verbatim text,

        http://somewhere.com      # ok in verbatim

C<LE<lt>http://...E<gt>> linking of URLs is new in the Perl 5.8 POD
specification.  It comes out badly from the formatters in earlier Perl (the
"/" is taken to be a section delimiter).  For that reason this policy only
applies if there's an explicit C<use 5.008> or higher in the code.

    use 5.005;

=for ProhibitVerbatimMarkup allow next

    =item C<http://foo.org>       # ok, don't have Perl 5.8 L<>

Some obviously bogus URLs like C<LE<lt>http://foo.orgE<gt>> are ignored,
they'll only be as examples and won't go anywhere as a clickable link.  Some
C<CE<lt>E<gt>> for monospacing might look good.  Exactly what's ignored is
not quite settled, but currently includes variations like

    http://foo.com
    https://foo.org
    ftp://bar.org.au
    http://quux.com.au
    http://xyzzy.co.uk
    http://foo.co.nz
    http://host:port
    http://...

In the current implementation a URL is anything starting C<http://>,
C<https://>, C<ftp://>, C<news://> or C<nntp://>.

=head2 Disabling

If you don't care about this, for instance if it's hard enough to get your
programmers to write documentation at all without worrying about markup!,
then you can disable C<RequireLinkedURLs> from your F<~/.perlcriticrc> file
in the usual way (see L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),
