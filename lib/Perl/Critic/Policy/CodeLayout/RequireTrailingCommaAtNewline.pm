=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::RequireTrailingCommaAtNewline - comma at end of list at newline

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
addon.  It asks you to put a comma at the end of a list etc when it ends
with a newline,

    @array = ($one,
              $two     # bad
             );

    @array = ($one,
              $two,    # ok
             );

This makes no difference to how the code runs, so the policy is under the
"cosmetic" theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

The idea is to make it easier when editing the code -- you don't have to
remember to add a comma to a preceding item when extending or cutting and
pasting lines to re-arrange.

If the closing bracket is on the same line as the last element then no comma
is required.  It can be be used if desired, but is not required.

    $hashref = { abc => 123,
                 def => 456 };   # ok

Parens around an expression are not a list, so nothing is demanded in for
instace

    $foo = (
            1
            + 2        # ok
           );

But a single element paren expression like this is treated as a list when
it's in an array assignment or a function or method call.

    @foo = (
            1
            + 2        # bad
           );
            

    @foo = (
            1
            + 2,       # ok
           );

=head2 Return Statement

A C<return> statement with a single value is considered an expression so a
trailing comma is not required.

    return ($x
            + $y    # ok
            );

Whether such code is a single-value expression, or a list of only one value,
depends on how the function is specified.  There's nothing much in the text
(nor even at runtime) which would say for sure.

It's handy to included parens around a single-value expression to make it
clear some big arithmetic is all part of the return, especially if you can't
remember precedence levels very well.  And in such an expression a newline
before the final ")" can help keep a comment together with a term for a cut
and paste, or not lose a paren if commenting the last line etc.  So for now
the policy is to be lenient.  Would an option be good though?

=head1 BUGS

Is a C<return> statement an expression or a list?

    return (1
            + 2
            + 3    # should this be ok, or not?
           );

Strictly speaking it would depend whether the intention in subr is a list
return or a single value, where there's no way to distinguish.  Perhaps it
should be allowed if there's just one expression.



=head2 Disabling

As always if you don't care about this you can disable
C<RequireTrailingCommaAtNewline> from F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way (see
L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),

    [-CodeLayout::RequireTrailingCommaAtNewline]

=head2 Other Ways to Do It

This policy is a variation of C<CodeLayout::RequireTrailingCommas>.  That
policy doesn't apply to function calls or hashref constructors, and you may
find its requirement for a trailing comma in even one-line lists like
C<@x=(1,2,)> too much.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=item C<except_function_calls> (boolean, default false)

If true then function calls and method calls are not checked, allowing for
instance

    foo (
      1,
      2     # ok under except_function_calls
    );

The idea is that if C<foo()> takes only two arguments then you don't want to
write a trailing comma as it might suggest something more could be added.

Whether you write calls spread out this way is a matter of personal
preference.  If you do then enable C<except_function_calls> with the
following in your F<.perlcriticrc> file,

    [CodeLayout::RequireTrailingCommaAtNewline]
    except_function_calls=1
