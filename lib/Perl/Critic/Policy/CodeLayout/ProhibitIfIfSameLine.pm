=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::ProhibitIfIfSameLine - don't put if after if on same line

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
add-on.  It asks you to not to write an C<if> statement on the same line as
a preceding C<if>.

    if ($x) {
      ...
    } if ($y) {       # bad
      ...
    }

    if ($x) {
      ...
    } elsif ($y) {    # was "elsif" intended ?
      ...
    }

The idea is that an C<if> in the layout of an C<elsif> may be either a
mistake or will be confusing to a human reader.  On that basis this policy
is under the "bugs" theme and medium severity (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY
THEMES>).

=head2 Unless

An C<unless...if> is treated the same.  Perl allows C<unless ... elsif> and
so the same potential confusion with an C<elsif> layout arises.

    unless ($x) {
      ...
    } if ($y) {       # bad
      ...
    }

    unless ($x) {
      ...
    } elsif ($y) {    # maybe meant to be "elsif" like this ?
      ...
    }

Whether C<unless ... elsif> is a good idea at all is another matter.
Sometimes it suits a combination of conditions.

=head2 Statement Modifiers

This policy only applies to a statement followed by a statement.  An C<if>
as a statement modifier is not affected.  It's usual to put that on the same
line as the statement it modifies.

    do {
      ...
    } if ($x);        # ok, statement modifier

=head2 All One Line

Two C<if> statements written on the same line will trigger the policy.

    if(1){one;}   if(2){two;}      # bad

Perhaps there could be an exception or option when both statements are
entirely on the one line, or some such, for code which is trying to be
compact.

=head2 Disabling

As always if you don't care about this then you can disable
C<ProhibitIfIfSameLine> from your F<.perlcriticrc> (see
L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),
