=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::ProhibitFatCommaNewline - keep a fat comma on the same line as its quoted word

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
add-on.  It reports a newline between a fat comma and preceding bareword for
Perl builtins,

    my %h = (caller         # bad, builtin called as a function
             => 'abc');

And for all words when targeting Perl 5.6 and earlier,

    use 5.006;
    my %h = (foo            # bad, all words in perl 5.6 and earlier
             => 'def');

When there's a newline between the word and the fat comma like this the word
executes as a function call (builtins always, and also user defined in Perl
5.6 and earlier), giving its return value rather than a word string.

Such a return value is probably not what was intended and on that basis this
policy is under the "bugs" theme and medium severity (see
L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

=head2 Builtins

Perl builtin functions with a newline always execute and give their return
value rather than a the quoted word.

    my %h = (print          # bad, builtin print() executes
             => "abc");
    # %h is key "1" value "abc"

The builtin is called with no arguments and that might provoke a warning
from some, but others like C<print> will quietly run.

Dashed builtin names such as C<-print> are also function calls, with a
negate operator.

    my %h = (-print       # bad, print() call and negate
             => "123");
    # h is key "-1" value "123"

For the purposes of this policy the builtins are C<is_perl_builtin()> from
L<Perl::Critic::Utils>.  It's possible this is more builtins than the
particular Perl in use, but guarding against all will help if going to a
newer Perl in the future.

=head2 Non-Builtins

In Perl 5.6 and earlier all words C<foo> execute as a function call when
there's a newline before the fat comma.

    sub foo {
      return 123
    }
    my %h = (foo
             => "def");
    # in Perl 5.6 and earlier %h is key "123" value "def"

Under C<use strict> an error is thrown if no such function, in the usual
way.  A word builtin is a function call if it exists (with a warning about
being interpreted that way), or a bareword if not.

This policy prohibits all words with newline before fat comma when targeting
Perl 5.6 or earlier.  This means either an explicit C<use 5.006> or smaller,
or no such minimum C<use> at all.

One subtle way an executing word with newline before fat comma can go
undetected (in 5.6 and earlier still) is an accidental redefinition of a
constant,

    use constant FOO => "blah";
    use constant FOO
      => "some value";
    # makes a constant subr called blah (in Perl 5.6)

C<constant.pm> might reject some return values from C<FOO()>, eg. a number,
but a string like "blah" here quietly expands and creates a constant
C<blah()>.

The difference between Perl 5.6 and later Perl is that in 5.6 the parser
only looked as far as a newline for a possible quoting C<=E<gt>> fat comma.
In Perl 5.8 and later for non-builtins the lookahead continues beyond any
newlines and comments.  For Perl builtins the behaviour is the same, in all
versions the lookahead stops at the newline.

=head2 Avoiding Problems

Putting the fat comma on the same line as the word ensures it quotes in all
cases.

    my %h = (-print =>    # ok, fat comma on same line quotes
             "123");

If for layout purposes you do want a newline then the suggestion is to give
a string or perhaps a parenthesized expression since that doesn't rely on
the C<=E<gt>> fat comma quoting.  A fat comma can still emphasize a
key/value pair.

    my %h = ('print'      # ok, string
             =>
             123);

Alternately if instead a function call is really what's intended (builtin or
otherwise) then parens can be used in the normal way to ensure it's a call
(as per L<perltrap> the rule being "if it looks like a function, it is a
function").

    my %h = (foo()        # ok, function call
             =>
             123);

=head2 Disabling

As always if you don't care about this then you can disable
C<ProhibitFatCommaNewline> from your F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual
way (see L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),
