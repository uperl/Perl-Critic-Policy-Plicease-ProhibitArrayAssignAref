=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Modules::ProhibitModuleShebang - don't put a #! line at the start of a module file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
addon.  It asks you not to use a C<#!> interpreter line in a F<.pm> module
file.

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w      <-- bad
    package Foo;
    ...

This C<#!> does nothing, and might make a reader think it's supposed to be a
program instead of a module.  Often the C<#!> is a leftover cut and paste
from a script into a module, perhaps when grabbing a copyright notice or
similar intro.

Of course a module works the same with or without, so this policy is low
priority and under the "cosmetic" theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

Only the first line of a file is a prospective C<#!> interpreter.  A C<#!>
anywhere later is allowed, for example in code which generates other code,

    sub foo {
      print <<HERE;
    #!/usr/bin/make         <-- ok
    # Makefile generated by Foo.pm - DO NOT EDIT
    ...

This policy applies only to F<.pm> files.  Anything else, such as C<.pl> or
C<.t> scripts can have C<#!>, or not, in the usual way.  The F<.pm> filename
is used because it's hard to distinguish a module from a script just from
its contents.

=head2 Disabling

If you don't care about this you can always disable C<ProhibitModuleShebang>
from your F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way,

    [-Modules::ProhibitModuleShebang]

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=item C<allow_bin_false> (boolean, default true)

If true then allow C<#!/bin/false> in module files.

    #! /bin/false           <-- ok

This will prevent execution of the code if accidentally run as a script, but
whether you want this is a personal preference.  Insofar as it indicates a
module is not a script it accords with ProhibitModuleShebang, but in general
it's probably unnecessary.
