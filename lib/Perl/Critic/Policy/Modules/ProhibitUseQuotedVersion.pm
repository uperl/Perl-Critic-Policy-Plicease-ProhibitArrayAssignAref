=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Modules::ProhibitUseQuotedVersion - avoid quoted version number string in a "use" statement

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
addon.  It prohibits a quoted version number string as the sole argument to
a C<use> or C<no> statement.

    use Foo::Bar '1.50';      # bad
    use Foo::Bar 1.50;        # ok

    no Abc::Def '2.000_010';  # bad
    no Abc::Def 2.000_010;    # ok

The unquoted form uses Perl's builtin module version check and always works.
The quoted form relies on the module in question to do the check.  If it has
no C<import> then the quoted form is silently ignored, without the intended
check.

L<C<Exporter>|Exporter> which is used by many modules provides an C<import>
that checks a version number arg, so those modules are fine.  But the idea
of this policy is to do what works always, and on that basis is under the
"bugs" theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

The policy only applies to a single version number string argument, anything
else is taken to be some module parameter.

    no Abc::Def '123', 'ABC';   # ok
    use lib '..';               # ok

If you're a bit nervous about floating point version numbers because they're
often not exactly representable in binary, well that's true, but in practice
it works out ok, due to either converting the same way everywhere in the
program or being treated as a string in the "version" module anyway.

If you're confident about the C<import> in modules you use and prefer the
string form you can always disable C<ProhibitUseQuotedVersion> from your
F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way,

    [-Modules::ProhibitUseQuotedVersion]
