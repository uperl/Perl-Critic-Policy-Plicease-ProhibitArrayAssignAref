=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitFiletest_f - don't use the -f file test

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
addon.  It asks you not to use the C<-f> file test because it's so often
wrong or unnecessarily restrictive (and on that basis this policy is under
the "bugs" theme, see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

=over 4

=item C<-f> is not the opposite of C<-d>

If you're traversing a tree and want to distinguish files to process from
directories to descend into then C<-d> should be used so device files or
pipes can be processed.

    if (-f $filename) {      # bad
      process ($filename);
    } else {
      descend ($filename);
    }

    if (-d $filename) {      # better
      descend ($filename);
    } else {
      process ($filename);
    }

=item C<-f> doesn't mean readable/writable/seekable

Char specials and named pipes are perfectly good for reading and writing,
and char specials can support seeking.  Demanding C<-f> is an unnecessary
restriction in your code.  You might only ever use ordinary files normally,
but there's no need to prevent someone else running it on a tape drive,
F</dev/null>, etc.  You must test each C<seek> etc for success anyway, and
that will tell you if it's seekable.

    seek HANDLE, 123, 0
      or die "Error seeking: $!";

=item C<-e> better than C<-f>

A few inflexible functions or operations may not have a good "file not
found" indication and may force you to test for a file before invoking.
Using C<-e> is better than C<-f> as again it doesn't unnecessarily disallow
device files.

    if (-f $filename) {      # bad
      require $filename;
    }

    if (-e $filename) {      # better
      require $filename;
    }

=item C<-f> before opening is a race condition

Testing a filename before opening is bad.  Any test before opening is
basically useless because the file can change or be removed in between the
test and the open.

    if (-f $filename) {               # bad
      open HANDLE, '<', $filename
    }

If you want to know if the file can be opened then open the file!  The error
return from open must be checked, so a test beforehand only duplicates that,
and is an opportunity to wrongly anticipate what the system can or can't do.
On opening C<ENOENT> will say if there was no such file, or C<EISDIR> if
it's in fact a directory.

    if (! open HANDLE, '<', $filename) {  # better
      if ($! == POSIX::ENOENT()) {
        ...
      }
    }

If you really do want to enquire into the nature of the file, to only allow
ordinary files, then C<-f> can be used on the opened handle.  That's unusual
outside an archiving or backup program.

Incidentally, for error messages C<$!> is normally the best thing to print.
It can be slightly technical, but its values are familiar from other
programs and are translated into the user's locale.

=head2 Disabling

Most uses of C<-f> tend to be shell script style code written in Perl.  In
the shell it's usually not possible to do better (though C<-d> or C<-e> is
generally wanted instead of C<-f>), but in Perl it is.

A blanket prohibition like this policy is harsh, but is meant as a building
block or at least to make you think carefully whether C<-f> is really right.
As always though you can disable C<ProhibitFiletest_f> from your
F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way (see L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),
