=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyCommas - disallow empty consecutive commas

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
addon.  It prohibits empty comma operators C<,> or C<=E<gt>> meaning either
consecutive commas or a comma at the start of a list or expression.

    print 'foo',,'bar';      # bad
    @a = (,1,2);             # bad
    foo (x, => 123);         # bad
    a =>=> 456;              # bad
    for (; $i++<10; $i++,,)  # bad
    func (,)                 # bad

Extra commas like this are harmless and simply collapse out when the program
runs (see L<perldata/List value constructors>), so this policy is only under
the "cosmetic" theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).  Usually this sort
of thing is just a stray, or leftover from cut and paste, or perhaps some
over-enthusiastic column layout.  Occasionally it can be something more
dubious,

    # did you mean 1..6 range operator?
    @a = (1,,6);        # bad

    # this is two args, did you want three?
    foo (1, , 2);       # bad

    # this is three args, probably you forgot a value
    bar (abc => ,       # bad
         def => 20);

A comma at the end of a list or call is allowed.  That's quite usual and can
be a good thing when cutting and pasting lines (see C<RequireTrailingCommas>
to mandate them!).

    @b = ("foo",
          "bar",  # ok
         );

If you use multiple commas in some systematic way for code layout you can
always disable C<ProhibitEmptyCommas> from your F<.perlcriticrc> file in the
usual way,

    [-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyCommas]
