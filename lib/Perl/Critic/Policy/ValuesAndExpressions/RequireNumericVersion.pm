=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::RequireNumericVersion - $VERSION a plain number

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
addon.  It ask you to use a plain number in module C<$VERSION> so that
version checking within a program will work properly.  This policy is under
the C<bugs> theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

Any literal number is fine, or a string which is a number, and for Perl 5.10
up the extra forms of the C<version> module too, but a non-numeric string is
not allowed.

    $VERSION = '1.2alpha';    # bad
    $VERSION = 123;           # ok
    $VERSION = '1.5';         # ok
    $VERSION = 1.200_001;     # ok
    $VERSION = '1.200_001';   # ok for 5.10 up

A number is needed for version checking like

    use Foo 1.0;       # Perl's module checking
    Foo->VERSION(1);   # app runtime check

and it's highly desirable so applications can do compares like

    if (Foo->VERSION >= 1.234) {

In each case a non-numeric string in C<$VERSION> provokes warnings, and may
end up appearing as a lesser version than intended.

    Argument "1.2.alpha" isn't numeric in subroutine entry

If you've loaded the C<version.pm> module, then a C<$VERSION> not accepted
by C<version.pm> will in fact croak

    use version;
    print "version ",Foo->VERSION,"\n";
    # croaks "Invalid version format ..." if $Foo::VERSION is bad

=head2 Scripts

This policy only looks at C<$VERSION> in modules.  C<$VERSION> in a script
can be anything, as it won't normally have a C<use> checks etc.  A script
C<$VERSION> is anything outside any C<package> statement, or under an
explicit C<package main>.

    package main;
    $VERSION = '1.5.prerelease';  # ok, script

=head2 Underscores in Perl 5.8 and Earlier

In Perl 5.8 and earlier a string like "1.200_333" is truncated to the
numeric part, ie. 1.200, and thus can fail to satisfy

    $VERSION = '1.222_333';   # bad
    $VERSION = 1.222_333;     # ok

    use Foo 1.222_331;  # unsatisfied by $VERSION='string' form

A number literal with an "_" is allowed.  Underscores in literals are
stripped out, as described in L<perldata>, but not in the automatic string
to number conversion and a string like C<$VERSION = '1.222_333'> provokes a
warning and stops at 1.222.

On CPAN an underscore in a distribution version number means a developer
pre-release.  But avoid that in module C<$VERSION> strings for the problems
above.  The suggestion is to either omit the underscore or make it a number
literal not a string,

    $VERSION = 1.002003;      # ok
    $VERSION = 1.002_003;     # ok

If using C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> then it may be necessary to put an explicit
C<VERSION> in F<Makefile.PL> to get the underscore in the dist name, rather
than C<VERSION_FROM> a module file, since C<VERSION_FROM> takes both the
above to be 1.002003.

=head2 C<version> module in Perl 5.10

In Perl 5.10 the C<use> etc module version checks parse C<$VERSION> with the
C<version.pm> module.  This policy allows C<version> module forms if there's
an explicit C<use 5.010> or higher in the file.

    use 5.010;
    $VERSION = '1.222_333';   # ok for 5.10
    $VERSION = '1.2.3';       # ok for 5.10

But this is still undesirable, as an application check like

    if (Foo->VERSION >= 1.234) {

gets the raw string from C<$VERSION> and thus a non-numeric warning and
truncation.  Perhaps applications should let C<UNIVERSAL.pm> do the check
with say

    if (eval { Foo->VERSION(1.234) }) {

or apply C<version-E<gt>new()> to one of the args.  (Could have another
policy to not explicitly compare C<$VERSION>, or perhaps an option to
tighten this policy to require numbers even in 5.10?)

=head2 Exponential Format

Exponential format strings like "1e6" are disallowed.  Exponential number
literals are fine.

    $VERSION = '2.125e6';   # bad
    $VERSION = 1e6;         # ok

Exponential strings don't work in Perl 5.10 because they're not recognised
by the C<version> module (v0.82).  They're fine in Perl 5.8 and earlier, but
this policy treats such a string as non-numeric in the interests of
compatibility with later Perl.  Exponentials in versions should be unusual
anyway.

=head2 Disabling

If you don't care about this policy at all then you can disable from your
F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way (see L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),

    [-ValuesAndExpressions::RequireNumericVersion]

=head2 Other Ways to Do It

All the version number stuff with underscores, multi-dots, v-nums, etc is a
diabolical mess.  And floating point in version checks is asking for
rounding error trouble (though fine in practice).  A radical simplification
is to just use integer version numbers.

    $VERSION = 42;

If you want sub-versions then increment by 100 say.  Even a YYYYMMDD date is
a possibility.

    $VERSION = 20110328;
