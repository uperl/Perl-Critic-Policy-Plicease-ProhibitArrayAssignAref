=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::RequireNumericVersion - $VERSION a plain number

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
addon.  It asks you to use a plain number in a module C<$VERSION> so that
Perl's builtin version works.

Any literal number is fine, or a string which is a number,

    $VERSION = 123;           # ok
    $VERSION = '1.5';         # ok
    $VERSION = 1.200_001;     # ok

For Perl 5.10 and higher the extra forms of the C<version> module too,

    use 5.010;
    $VERSION = '1.200_001';   # ok for 5.10 up, version.pm

But a non-number string is not allowed,

    $VERSION = '1.2alpha';    # bad

The idea of this requirement is that a plain number is needed for Perl's
builtin module version checking like the following, and on that basis this
policy is under the "bugs" theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

    use Foo 1.0;
    Foo->VERSION(1);

A plain number is also highly desirable so applications can do their own
compares like

    if (Foo->VERSION >= 1.234) {

In each case if C<$VERSION> is not a number then it provokes warnings, and
may end up appearing as a lesser version than intended.

    Argument "1.2.alpha" isn't numeric in subroutine entry

If you've loaded the C<version.pm> module then a C<$VERSION> not accepted by
C<version.pm> will in fact croak, which is an unpleasant variant behaviour.

    use version ();
    print "version ",Foo->VERSION,"\n";
    # croaks "Invalid version format ..." if $Foo::VERSION is bad

=head2 Scripts

This policy only looks at C<$VERSION> in modules.  C<$VERSION> in a script
can be anything since it won't normally be part of C<use> checks etc.
A script C<$VERSION> is anything outside any C<package> statement scope, or
under an explicit C<package main>.

    package main;
    $VERSION = '1.5.prerelease';  # ok, script

    $main::VERSION = 'blah';      # ok, script
    $::VERSION = 'xyzzy';         # ok, script

A fully-qualified package name is recognised as belonging to a module,

    $Foo::Bar::VERSION = 'xyzzy'; # bad

=head2 Underscores in Perl 5.8 and Earlier

In Perl 5.8 and earlier a string like "1.200_333" is truncated to the
numeric part, ie. 1.200, and can thus fail to satisfy

    $VERSION = '1.222_333';   # bad
    use Foo 1.222_331;  # not satisfied by $VERSION='string' form

But an actual number literal with an "_" is allowed.  Underscores in
literals are stripped out (see L<perldata>), but not in the automatic string
to number conversion so a string like C<$VERSION = '1.222_333'> provokes a
warning and stops at 1.222.

    $VERSION = 1.222_333;     # ok

On CPAN an underscore in a distribution version number is rated as a
developer pre-release.  But don't put it in module C<$VERSION> strings due
to the problems above.  The suggestion is to include the underscore in the
distribution filename but either omit it from the C<$VERSION> or make it a
number literal not a string,

    $VERSION = 1.002003;    # ok
    $VERSION = 1.002_003;   # ok, but not for VERSION_FROM

C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> C<VERSION_FROM> will take the latter as its numeric
value, ie. "1.002003" not "1.002_003" as the distribution version.  For the
latter you can either put an explicit C<VERSION> in F<Makefile.PL>

    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
    WriteMakefile (VERSION => '1.002_003');

Or you can trick MakeMaker with a string plus C<eval>,

    $VERSION = '1.002_003';    # ok evalled down
    $VERSION = eval $VERSION;

MakeMaker sees the string "1.002_003" but at runtime the C<eval> crunches it
down to a plain number 1.002003.  RequireNumericVersion notices such an
C<eval> and anything in C<$VERSION>.  Something bizarre in C<$VERSION> won't
be noticed, but that's too unlikely to worry about.

=head2 C<version> module in Perl 5.10 up

In Perl 5.10 C<use> etc module version checks parse C<$VERSION> with the
C<version.pm> module.  This policy allows the C<version> module forms if
there's an explicit C<use 5.010> or higher in the file.

    use 5.010;
    $VERSION = '1.222_333';   # ok for 5.10
    $VERSION = '1.2.3';       # ok for 5.10

But this is still undesirable, as an application check like

    if (Foo->VERSION >= 1.234) {

gets the raw string from C<$VERSION> and thus a non-numeric warning and
truncation.  Perhaps applications should let C<UNIVERSAL.pm> do the work
with say

    if (eval { Foo->VERSION(1.234) }) {

or apply C<version-E<gt>new()> to one of the args.  Maybe another policy to
not explicitly compare C<$VERSION>, or perhaps an option to tighten this
policy to require numbers even in 5.10?

=head2 Exponential Format

Exponential format strings like "1e6" are disallowed (except with the
C<eval> trick above).

    $VERSION = '2.125e6';   # bad

Exponential number literals are fine.

    $VERSION = 1e6;         # ok

Exponential strings don't work in Perl 5.10 because they're not recognised
by the C<version> module (v0.82).  They're fine in Perl 5.8 and earlier, but
in the interests of maximum compatibility this policy treats such a string
as non-numeric.  Exponentials in versions should be unusual anyway.

=head2 Disabling

If you don't care about this policy at all then you can disable from your
F<.perlcriticrc> in the usual way (see L<Perl::Critic/CONFIGURATION>),

    [-ValuesAndExpressions::RequireNumericVersion]

=head2 Other Ways to Do It

The version number system with underscores, multi-dots, v-nums, etc is
diabolical mess, and each new addition to it just seems to make it worse.
Even the original floating point in version checks is asking for rounding
error trouble (though normally fine in practice).  A radical simplification
is to just use integer version numbers.

    $VERSION = 123;

If you want sub-versions then increment by 100 or some such.  Even a
YYYYMMDD date is a possibility.

    $VERSION = 20110328;
