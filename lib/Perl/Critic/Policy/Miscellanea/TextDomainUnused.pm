=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Miscellanea::TextDomainUnused - check for Locale::TextDomain imported but unused

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This policy is part of the L<C<Perl::Critic::Pulp>|Perl::Critic::Pulp>
addon.  It reports when you have L<C<Locale::TextDomain>|Locale::TextDomain>
like

    use Locale::TextDomain ('MyMessageDomain');

but then don't use any of its functions or variables

    __ __x __n __nx __xn
    __p __px __np __npx
    N__ N__n N__p N__np
    %__ $__

C<Locale::TextDomain> is not needed when not used, but it's also not
actively harmful so this policy is only low priority and under the
C<cosmetic> theme (see L<Perl::Critic/POLICY THEMES>).

The check is good if you've got C<Locale::TextDomain> as boilerplate code in
most of your program, but in some modules it's unused.  You can remove it
entirely from non-interactive modules, or comment it out from modules which
might have messages but don't yet.  The best thing picked up is when your
boilerplate has got into a programmatic module which shouldn't say anything
at the user level.

The saving from removing unused C<Locale::TextDomain> is modest, just some
imports and a hash entry holding the "textdomain" for the package.

It's easy to imagine a general kind of "module imported but unused" policy
check, but in practice its hard for perlcritic to know the automatic imports
of every module, and quite a few modules have side-effects, so this
TextDomainUnused policy just starts with one case of an unused include.

=head2 Interpolated Variables

The variables C<%__> and C<$__> are recognised in double-quote interpolated
strings just by looking for a C<$__> somewhere in the string, eg.

    print "*** $__{'A Message'} ***\n";  # ok

It's not hard to trick the recognition with escapes, or a hash slice style,
but in general taking any C<$__> to be a TextDomain use is close enough.
(Perhaps in the future PPI will do a full parse of interpolated
expressions.)
