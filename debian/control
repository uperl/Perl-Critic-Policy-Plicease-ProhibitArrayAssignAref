# Build-Depends could have the "maximum_tests" modules from META.yml
# for more tests, but they're optional author tests really and would
# just make the build tools drag in more stuff.
#
# "Depends:" has "libversion-perl" for older perl or "perl-modules (>=
# 5.10)" for builtin, the same as the Depends in libperl-critic-perl
# itself.  Put libversion-perl first in the hope it makes "apt"
# inclined to download that rather than upgrade perl.
