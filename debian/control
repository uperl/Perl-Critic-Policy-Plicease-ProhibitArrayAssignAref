# "Build-Depends:" could have the "maximum_tests" modules from
# Makefile.PL for more tests, but they're optional and would just make
# the build tools drag in more stuff.
#
# "Depends:" has "libversion-perl" for older perl or "perl-modules (>=
# 5.10)" for builtin, the same as the Depends in libperl-critic-perl
# itself.  Put libversion-perl first in the hope it makes "apt"
# inclined to download that rather than upgrade perl.

Description: Some add-on policies for perlcritic
 This is some further policies for perlcritic:
 .
  * ConstantBeforeLt -- avoid problems with "FOO < 123"
  * ConstantPragmaHash -- version declaration for multi-constants
  * Gtk2Constants -- new enough Gtk2 version for its constants
  * NotWithCompare -- avoiding problems with "! $x == $y"
  * PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy -- Perl features used vs version declared
  * PodMinimumVersion -- POD features used vs Perl version declared
  * ProhibitEmptyCommas -- consecutive commas
  * ProhibitNullStatements -- find stray semicolons
  * ProhibitUseQuotedVersion -- unquote version string in use Foo '1.5'
  * RequireEndBeforeLastPod -- __END__ before POD at end of file
  * TextDomainPlaceholders -- check args to __x, __nx, etc
  * TextDomainUnused -- Locale::TextDomain imported but not used
  * UnexpandedSpecialLiteral -- check __PACKAGE__ etc unexpanded
