# Build-Depends could have the "maximum_tests" modules from META.yml
# for more tests, but they're optional author tests really and would
# just make the build tools drag in more stuff.
#
# "Depends:" has "libversion-perl" for older perl or "perl (>= 5.10)"
# for builtin version.pm, the same as the "Depends:" in
# libperl-critic-perl itself.  Put libversion-perl first in the hope
# it makes "apt" inclined to download that one rather than upgrade perl.
