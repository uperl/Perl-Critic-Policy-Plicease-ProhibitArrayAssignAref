# Build-Depends could have "libtest-pod-perl (>= 1.00)" but it's
# optional and only makes the build tools drag in more stuff.
#
# Depends has "libversion-perl" for older perl or "perl-modules (>=
# 5.10)" for builtin -- the same as the Depends in libperl-critic-perl
# itself.  But have libversion-perl first in case that makes apt
# inclined to download that rather than upgrade perl.
