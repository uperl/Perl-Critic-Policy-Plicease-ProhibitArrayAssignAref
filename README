This is some add-on policies for Perl::Critic,

* ConstantBeforeLt -- avoiding problems with "FOO < 123"

* ConstantPragmaHash -- version declaration for hash style multi-constants

* Gtk2Constants -- new enough Gtk2 version for its constants

* NotWithCompare -- avoiding problems with "! $x == $y"

* PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy -- Perl features used vs version declared

* PodMinimumVersion -- POD features used vs Perl version declared

* ProhibitEmptyCommas -- consecutive commas

* ProhibitNullStatements -- find stray semicolons

* ProhibitPOSIXimport -- don't import the whole of POSIX

* ProhibitUseQuotedVersion -- unquote version string in use Foo '1.5'

* RequireEndBeforeLastPod -- __END__ before POD at end of file

* TextDomainPlaceholders -- check args to __x, __nx, etc

* TextDomainUnused -- Locale::TextDomain imported but not used

* UnexpandedSpecialLiteral -- using __PACKAGE__ etc unexpanded


The only major prerequisite is Perl::Critic itself, though
PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy does nothing without Perl::MinimumVersion.
