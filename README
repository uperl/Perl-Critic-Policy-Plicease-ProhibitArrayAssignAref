This is some add-on policies for Perl::Critic,

* ConstantBeforeLt -- avoiding problems with "FOO < 123"

* ConstantPragmaHash -- version declaration for hash style multi-constants

* NotWithCompare -- avoiding problems with "! $x == $y"

* ProhibitEmptyCommas -- consecutive commas

* ProhibitNullStatements -- find stray semicolons

* RequireEndBeforeLastPod -- __END__ before POD at end of file

* TextDomainPlaceholders -- check args to __x and __nx

* UnexpandedSpecialLiteral -- using __PACKAGE__ etc unexpanded


The only prerequisite is Perl::Critic itself.  The Perl-Critic-Pulp
home page is
